# üöÄ START HERE - OCR Service Setup

## üéØ What Happened

Your OCR service has been **successfully improved** with better reliability, security, and performance. However, during the review, we discovered that **API keys were exposed in git history**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Security Issue Found

**Status**: üî¥ REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

Your `.env.local` file contained real API keys that were committed to git. These keys are now visible in:
- Git history
- GitHub repository (if pushed)
- Any clones of the repository

## üö® What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Read the Security Alert (5 minutes)

Open and read: **`SECURITY_ALERT.md`**

This file contains:
- List of exposed keys
- Risk assessment
- Detailed remediation steps

### Step 2: Follow the Immediate Actions (30 minutes)

Open and follow: **`IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md`**

Quick checklist:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Check OpenAI billing for unauthorized usage
2. üîë Revoke all exposed API keys
3. ‚ú® Generate new API keys
4. üîí Update environment variables
5. ‚úÖ Test the application

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script (15 minutes)

We've created automated scripts to help you:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\setup-secure-environment.ps1
```

**Mac/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
bash setup-secure-environment.sh
```

These scripts will:
- Verify .gitignore is correct
- Generate new JWT secret
- Guide you through updating .env.local
- Verify security
- Test the application

### Step 4: Deploy Safely (30 minutes)

Once security is fixed, follow: **`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`**
