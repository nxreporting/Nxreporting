# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing PDF Data Extraction & Reporting System from a Railway + PlanetScale architecture to a fully Vercel + Supabase architecture with automated Git-based deployments. The migration aims to consolidate the entire application stack under Vercel's platform while leveraging Supabase for database and backend services, eliminating the need for separate backend hosting on Railway.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Full-Stack Vercel Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire application (frontend and backend API) deployed on Vercel, so that I can manage everything from a single platform with unified deployment and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main Git branch THEN Vercel SHALL automatically deploy both frontend and backend components
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL be served as a Next.js application on Vercel
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be handled by Vercel serverless functions (API routes)
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN both frontend and API endpoints SHALL be accessible via the same Vercel domain

### Requirement 2: Supabase Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Supabase as the database provider, so that I can leverage its PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication and real-time features while maintaining compatibility with the existing Prisma schema.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN it SHALL use Supabase PostgreSQL instead of PlanetScale
2. WHEN database migrations are run THEN the existing Prisma schema SHALL be compatible with Supabase PostgreSQL
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to Supabase using the DATABASE_URL
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL maintain the same functionality as the current implementation

### Requirement 3: Backend API Migration to Serverless

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert the Express.js backend to Next.js API routes, so that the backend logic runs as serverless functions on Vercel instead of requiring a separate server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL be handled by Next.js API routes in the `/pages/api/` directory
2. WHEN file uploads occur THEN they SHALL be processed by serverless functions with appropriate file handling
3. WHEN PDF extraction is performed THEN it SHALL work within Vercel's serverless function constraints
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN JWT-based auth SHALL continue to work in the serverless environment
5. WHEN middleware is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented using Next.js middleware patterns

### Requirement 4: File Storage Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want file uploads to work seamlessly after migration, so that I can continue uploading and processing PDF files without any functionality loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in a persistent storage solution compatible with Vercel
2. WHEN files are processed THEN the extraction functionality SHALL work within serverless function limits
3. WHEN files are accessed THEN they SHALL be retrievable for processing and download
4. IF Vercel's ephemeral storage is insufficient THEN an external storage service SHALL be integrated

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all environment variables properly configured for the new architecture, so that the application works correctly in the Vercel + Supabase environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all necessary environment variables SHALL be configured in Vercel
2. WHEN database connections are made THEN the Supabase DATABASE_URL SHALL be properly set
3. WHEN external APIs are called THEN API keys (Nanonets, OpenAI) SHALL be accessible to serverless functions
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow proper communication between frontend and API routes

### Requirement 6: Automated Git Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic deployments triggered by Git pushes, so that I don't need to manually deploy changes and can maintain a streamlined development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN Vercel SHALL automatically trigger a new deployment
2. WHEN a deployment starts THEN it SHALL build both frontend and backend components
3. WHEN build processes run THEN they SHALL include database migrations and Prisma client generation
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the new version SHALL be live without manual intervention
5. WHEN deployment fails THEN the previous version SHALL remain active and errors SHALL be logged

### Requirement 7: Database Migration and Data Preservation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing data to be preserved during the migration, so that no user data or uploaded files are lost in the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration occurs THEN all existing user accounts SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN all uploaded files and extracted data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the new system is active THEN all existing functionality SHALL work with migrated data
4. WHEN data integrity is verified THEN all relationships and constraints SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform as well or better after migration, so that PDF processing and data extraction remain fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF files are processed THEN extraction time SHALL not exceed current performance benchmarks
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN serverless functions SHALL scale automatically
3. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be processed within Vercel's function timeout limits
4. IF function limits are exceeded THEN appropriate error handling and user feedback SHALL be provided

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling in the new architecture, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and accessible through Vercel's monitoring tools
2. WHEN functions timeout or fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be returned to users
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN Vercel Analytics and Supabase monitoring SHALL provide insights

### Requirement 10: Development Workflow Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local development environment to remain functional, so that I can continue developing and testing features locally before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the Next.js development server SHALL serve both frontend and API routes
2. WHEN testing locally THEN the application SHALL connect to a Supabase development database
3. WHEN making changes THEN the development workflow SHALL support hot reloading for both frontend and backend
4. WHEN running locally THEN all existing npm scripts and development tools SHALL continue to work
